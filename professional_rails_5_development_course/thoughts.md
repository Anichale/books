### Section 1
- setting up ruby, rvm, gems and installing rails was painless compared to other technologies set up to be as fully featured as rails is
- structure & detail of course is good so far, no "magic" explanations. the only downside is that it requires more time.

### Section 2
- organizing course through pivotal feels organized and objectives are clearer
- `rails g scaffold` feels like magic. the development experience is smooth, however and I can see how Meteor was originally being compared as rails for javascript, or as a direct competitor to rails. although, i feel at ease learning rails as its maturity has been proven.
- reserved keywords for resources from a scaffold
  - index - _list of multiple items from a model_
  - new - _instantiates model_
  - create - _communicates with model_
  - update - _communicates with model_
  - edit - _instantiates update of model_
  - destroy - _DESTRUCTION_
- resource routing === less boilerplate

### Section 4 - in progress
- generators are great to ensure adhering to the "rails way", but it is probably awesome for quick prototyping and focusing on the purpose of the application vs. how it is built
